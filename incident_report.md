===========================================================

### Executive Summary
-------------------

A high-severity brute-force attack was detected targeting the admin account from a known malicious IP address (203.0.113.55). The attack resulted in multiple failed login attempts within a short time frame, posing an immediate risk to system security and potentially leading to unauthorized access.

**Business Impact:** High urgency is required to prevent potential data breaches or system compromise.

### Incident Timeline
-------------------

* **Aug 11 17:15:12**: Multiple failed login attempts from IP address 203.0.113.55 targeting the admin account.
* **Aug 11 17:15:12**: Invalid user login attempt from the same IP address, further indicating malicious activity.

### Technical Analysis
--------------------

The attack vectors identified include:

* Brute-force attacks on the admin account using multiple failed login attempts within a short time frame.
* Invalid user login attempts from a known malicious IP range.

Techniques used by attackers:

* **Brute-Force Attack**: Attempting to guess or crack passwords through repeated login attempts.
* **Invalid User Login**: Attempting to log in with invalid usernames or credentials.

Success/Failure of Attempts:

* Multiple failed login attempts were successful, indicating the attacker's persistence and potential for future success if not addressed.

### Threat Intelligence Summary
------------------------------

The IP address 203.0.113.55 is associated with a high-risk threat profile:

* **Abuse Confidence Score**: 100 (indicating a very high confidence in malicious activity).
* **Country of Origin**: China.
* **ISP**: China Telecom.
* **Previous Attack History**: SSH brute-force attempts reported on multiple occasions.

### Risk Assessment
------------------
