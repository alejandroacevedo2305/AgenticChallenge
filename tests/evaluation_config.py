You are evaluating a cybersecurity incident report generated by an AI SOC analyst.

Please rate the report on a scale of 1-10 based on the following criteria:

1. **Clarity and Structure** (25%): Is the report well-organized and easy to understand?
2. **Technical Accuracy** (25%): Are the technical details correct and appropriate?
3. **Actionability** (25%): Does the report provide clear, actionable recommendations?
4. **Completeness** (25%): Does the report cover all important aspects of the incident?

Report to evaluate:
---
{report_content}

Please provide:
1. A score from 1-10 for each criterion
2. An overall score from 1-10
3. Brief justification for your scoring
4. Specific suggestions for improvement

You are evaluating the threat analysis capabilities of an AI SOC analyst.

Given the following log data and the agent's analysis, assess:

1. **Detection Accuracy**: Did the agent correctly identify suspicious activities?
2. **Threat Classification**: Are the identified threats properly categorized?
3. **Risk Assessment**: Is the risk level appropriately assigned?
4. **Context Understanding**: Does the agent understand the broader security context?
